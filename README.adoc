= Othello.rs

continuing with a recurring theme I have, it's yet another othello bot,
but in Rust this time.

NOTE: this is a reimplementation of an othello bot i made a while back, +
but hosted on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/aurumcodex/othellors

this is more or less for an education and curiosity standpoint more than anything.
i blame my class on A.I. in college for my facination with othello in general.

._algorithms implemented (or to be implemented)_
- minmax w/ alpha-beta pruning
- negamax w/ alpha-beta pruning
- rng move generation

NOTE: view the TODO file to see what remains to be implemented.
