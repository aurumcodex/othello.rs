= TODO list for `othello_rs`

== implementations

=== `lib.rs`
- [x] implement main game loop in `play_othello` and derivatives (needs bugfixing, though)
- [ ] add help message to the `print_help` function (implement in `mod util`)
- [x] add functions to run the game in ascii mode, colored ascii mode, and full TUI mode
- [ ] finish `Opts` struct
** [x] add a `&str` to hold a string for forcing a particular algorithm
** [ ] add a `&str` or `bool` to hold a value to use either weighted board or max disc based evaluation
** [x] add a `&str` or set of `bool`s for toggling which runtime fuction to use (or make it compile time based with features)
** [ ] add a `bool` flag for running a simulation against itself
** [ ] add validation function(s) for `&str` version of flag for algorithm forcing

=== `othello::bot.rs`
- [x] implement `generate_alpha_beta_move` (sort of done)
- [x] implement `generate_negamax_move` (sort of done)
- [x] implement `make_move` using mentioned functions (sort of done)
** [ ] implement an "auto" decision for `make_move`

=== `othello::algorithms.rs`
- [x] implement `alpha_beta` algorithm
- [x] implement `negamax` algorithm
- [ ] add other search algorithms (optional)

== project structure
- [ ] migrate the functions for the different runtime modes into separate module dir (or not)
- [ ] put functions into own module files within `game` module dir
- [ ] add documentation for project for project completeness
- [ ] (completely optional, but consider adding testing modules? (probably won't be necessary))
= [ ] *IMPORTANT*: consider a bitboard implementation?

== bugfixes
- [ ] `negamax`: negation with overflow error, need to find out more
- [ ] display(s): funky things going on there
